# Seize


This project aims to be my vision of what should be a "bloc note" on computer.

The objective is principally the writing of texts (rap, poems, anything, even ur _dissert de francais_ if u want),
but it may became more specific to the writing of rap texts (maybe with an audio reader inside ?)

*Maybe one day it will arrive on android too ?*
